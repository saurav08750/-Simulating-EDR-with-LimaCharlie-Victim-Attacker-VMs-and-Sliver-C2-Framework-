# -Simulating-EDR-with-LimaCharlie-Victim-Attacker-VMs-and-Sliver-C2-Framework-

I have Worked on a home lab using blog posts and simulated Endpoint Detection and
Response(EDR) system which consists of a Windows 10 victim virtual(VM) machine,
Linux attacker VM, and LimaCharlie with EDR-like ability. Installed a sensor on the victim
machine that collects and analyzes log files and, after simulating attacks using Sliver C2 a
command and control framework, created detection rules leveraging the Sigma rule to
identify and block abnormal activities. Fine-tuned the detection rules to minimize false
positives, enhancing the systemâ€™s threat detection and prevention capabilities.
